# Summary
Computer Science graduate with focus on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision problem solving. Proven experience designing and implementing real-time inference systems over video streams, as well as training deep learning models for computer vision applications.

# Experience
## **[Mind Colab](https://mindcolab.com/)**, Computer Scientist

July 2025 – present



7 months

Designed and implemented a real-time inference engine built on GStreamer pipelines, capable of processing up to 6 parallel RTSP streams at up to 1080p and 25 FPS, maintaining frame drop below 1% under load. The system follows a multi-process architecture with shared-memory IPC to minimize unnecessary copies and reduce end-to-end latency.



- **Flow control**: Implemented backpressure handling using GStreamer queues to sustain stable throughput under concurrent load.

- **Acceleration stack**: GPU-based implementation leveraging NVIDIA DeepStream, NVMM buffers, CUDA kernels (Numba), and CUDA-enabled OpenCV for preprocessing.

- **Inference optimization**: Executed YOLO/PyTorch models with frames kept predominantly on GPU, reducing CPU↔GPU transfer overhead.

- **Lifecycle & operations**: Supported controlled restarts, hot configuration reloads via a custom DSL, and graceful shutdowns in 24/7 environments.

- **Observability**: Measured per-stage pipeline latency and monitored GPU, VRAM, RAM, and CPU utilization under sustained load.

- **Technical impact**: Migrated from a CPU-bound solution to GPU acceleration, enabling real-time stream retransmission where it was previously not feasible.

## **[Klari Inc.](https://klari.ai/)**, Data Scientist Intern (200 hours)

Jan 2025 – Feb 2025



2 months

Designed and implemented a semantic analysis system for conversations generated by an LLM-based chatbot, aimed at extracting thematic patterns and producing actionable reports on user behavior and interaction quality.



- **NLP pipeline**: Semantic representation of conversations using embeddings.

- **Thematic analysis**: Unsupervised clustering to extract conversational patterns.



## **[CICDa Research Group](https://sites.google.com/view/cicda/home)**, Thesis Research

Jan 2024 – Jan 2025



1 year 1 month

Conducted publication-oriented research focused on satellite image segmentation for post-disaster building damage detection and estimation, using temporal image comparison and Siamese deep learning architectures.



- **xBD dataset**: Trained on ~2,400 VHR satellite images for Building Damage Assessment tasks.

- **End-to-end pipeline**: Preprocessing, training, inference, and post-processing for semantic segmentation and multitemporal structural change detection.

- **Computer vision modeling**: Trained deep learning models for post-disaster building semantic segmentation.

- **Experimental evaluation**: Quantitative analysis using classification and segmentation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

- **Compute**: Training executed on a High Performance Computing cluster with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs.
