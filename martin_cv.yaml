      - company: "[Mind Colab](https://mindcolab.com/)"
        position: Computer Scientist
        start_date: 2024-07
        end_date: present
        summary: >
          Designed and implemented a real-time inference engine built on GStreamer pipelines,
          capable of processing up to 6 parallel RTSP streams at 720p and 25 FPS,
          maintaining frame drop below 1% under load.
          The system follows a multi-process architecture with shared-memory IPC
          to minimize unnecessary copies and reduce end-to-end latency.
        highlights:
          - "**Flow control**: Implemented backpressure handling using GStreamer queues to sustain stable throughput under concurrent load."
          - "**Acceleration stack**: GPU-based implementation leveraging NVIDIA DeepStream, NVMM buffers, CUDA kernels (Numba), and CUDA-enabled OpenCV for preprocessing."
          - "**Inference optimization**: Executed YOLO/PyTorch models with frames kept predominantly on GPU, reducing CPU↔GPU transfer overhead."
          - "**Lifecycle & operations**: Supported controlled restarts, hot configuration reloads via a custom DSL, and graceful shutdowns in 24/7 environments."
          - "**Observability**: Measured per-stage pipeline latency and monitored GPU, VRAM, RAM, and CPU utilization under sustained load."
          - "**Technical impact**: Migrated from a CPU-bound solution to GPU acceleration, enabling real-time stream retransmission where it was previously not feasible."

        summary: >
          Designed and implemented a semantic analysis system for conversations generated by an LLM-based chatbot,
          aimed at extracting thematic patterns and producing actionable reports on user behavior
          and interaction quality.
        highlights:
          - "**NLP pipeline**: Semantic representation of conversations using embeddings."
          - "**Thematic analysis**: Unsupervised clustering to extract conversational patterns."

          Conducted publication-oriented research focused on satellite image segmentation
          for post-disaster building damage detection and estimation, using temporal image comparison
          and Siamese deep learning architectures.
        highlights:
          - "**xBD dataset**: Trained on ~2,400 VHR satellite images for Building Damage Assessment tasks."
          - "**End-to-end pipeline**: Preprocessing, training, inference, and post-processing for semantic segmentation and multitemporal structural change detection."
          - "**Computer vision modeling**: Trained deep learning models for post-disaster building semantic segmentation."
          - "**Experimental evaluation**: Quantitative analysis using classification and segmentation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score)."
          - "**Compute**: Training executed on a High Performance Computing cluster with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs."
